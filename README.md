ipsync
======

This program depends on 1 file (ip_sync_config.txt) and 
creates 2 files (ip_address.txt and ip_change_tracker.csv).

To use this program, download the code to your favorite 
linux flavor.  Install ldc2 and libcurl-dev and use
the makefile to create the host and client.

Check out the blog for more detailed explanation.
