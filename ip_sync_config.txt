 + This program depends on 
 + this configuration file 
 + containing valid fields 
 + for username, password,
 + folder and subject.  
 + 
 + If the cipher is used then
 + the sentence needs to be 
 + completed and each grammar
 + type needs an array of 11 
 + words. The parser just 
 + looks up the key value, so
 + if you wanted ProperNoun
 + instead of just noun, that
 + would work as well.
